# Udemy Course Projects

This repository contains many of the course projects that I've completed on the online platform, [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/).  
Each project folder contains a `README.md` file detailing:

-   What I adjusted from the original project
-   The focus areas that I continued to develop with
-   Lessons I learned from the project
